# Dashboard for WinForms - How to calculate Highest Product Sales by Year


This exampleÂ demonstrates how to use the [Aggr](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/115870) function to display products with the highest sales by year.

Aggregated data use the following custom expressions:

| Calculated Field | Expression |
| --- | --- |
| Max Product Sales by Year | ``` Aggr(Max([Product Sales by Year]), GetYear([OrderDate])) ``` |
| Product Sales by Year | ``` Aggr(Sum([Sales]), GetYear([OrderDate]), [ProductName]) ``` |
| Highest Product Sales | ``` Iif([Max Product Sales by Year] = [Product Sales by Year], [ProductName] + ' ($ ' + [Product Sales by Year] + ')', null) ``` |
